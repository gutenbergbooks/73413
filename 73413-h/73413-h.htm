<div class="divBody">
<p class="first salute"><span class="sc">My dear Sir George</span>,
</p>
<p>In inscribing to you this little book, I do no more than offer that which is your
due, as its appearance is mainly owing to you. It was by your desire that I wrote,
in 1861, to different Missionaries in South Africa, requesting them to make collections
of Native Literature, similar in nature to those which, through your instrumentality,
had been so abundantly rescued from oblivion in New Zealand. I then wrote, among others,
to the Rev. G. Krönlein, Rhenish Missionary at Beerseba, Great Namaqualand; but it
was not till after you had left us, on a new mission of honour and duty, that I received
from him (at five different periods) the original manuscripts from which most of the
Fables given here are translated. He sent us, altogether, twenty-four <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e666">[<a href="#xd32e666">12</a>]</span>Fables, Tales, and Legends, besides twelve Songs of Praise, thirty-two Proverbs, and
twelve Riddles; all in Hottentot (as taken down by him from the mouth of the Natives)
and German, partly accompanied by explanatory notes, including fragments of the <i lang="naq">ǀNūsa</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e670src" href="#xd32e670">1</a> Bushman language. Mr. Krönlein’s manuscripts fill sixty-five pages, mostly in quarto,
with double columns.
</p>
<p>You are aware that the existence of Fables among the Hottentots was already known
to us through Sir James Alexander’s “Expedition of Discovery into the Interior of
Africa” (8vo., two vols., London, 1838), and that some interesting specimens of their
literature had been given by him in that work; but that Fables form so extensive a
mass of traditionary Native literature amongst the Namaqua, has first been brought
to light by Mr. Krönlein’s communications. The fact of such a literary capacity existing
among a nation whose mental qualifications it has been usual to estimate at the lowest
standard, is of the greatest importance; and that their literary activity (in contradistinction
to the general character <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e677">[<a href="#xd32e677">13</a>]</span>of Native literature among Negro nations) has been employed almost in the same direction
as that which had been taken by our own earliest literature, is in itself of great
significance.
</p>
<p>Some questions of no trifling importance and interest are raised by the appearance
of such an unlooked-for mine of literary lore, particularly as to the originality
of these Fables. Whether they are indeed the real offspring of the desert, and can
be considered as truly indigenous Native literature, or whether they have been either
purloined from the superior white race, or at least brought into existence by the
stimulus which contact with the latter gave to the Native mind (like that resulting
in the invention of the Tshiroki and Vei alphabets) may be matters of dispute for
some time to come, and it may require as much research as was expended upon the solving
of the riddle of the originality of the Ossianic poems.
</p>
<p>But whatever may be the ultimate result of such inquiries, whether it will confirm
our idea of the originality and antiquity of the main portion of these Hottentot Fables,
and consequently stamp them with the character of the oldest and most primitive literary
remains of the old mother tongue of the Sexdenoting <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e682">[<a href="#xd32e682">14</a>]</span>nations, or whether they have only sprung up recently among the Hottentots from foreign
seed—in either case the disposition of the Hottentots to the enjoyment of such Fables,
and their easy growth on this arid soil, be it their native or adopted one—shows a
much greater congeniality between the Hottentot and European mind than we find between
the latter and any of the black races of Africa.
</p>
<p>This similarity in the disposition of nations can in itself indeed hardly be considered
as a valid proof of common ancestry; but if there be other grounds to make us believe
that the nations in question, or at least their languages, are of common origin, it
may render us more inclined to assume that such a similarity in their literary taste
is derived also from the same source.
</p>
<p>The great ethnological difference between the Hottentots and the black nations of
South Africa has been a marked fact from almost the earliest acquaintance of Europeans
with these parts, and occasional stray guesses (for example, in R. Moffat’s “Missionary
Labours and Scenes in Southern Africa,” 1842, p. 6), have already for some time pointed
to a North African origin for the Hottentots.
</p>
<p>It is, however, only within the last dozen years <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e688">[<a href="#xd32e688">15</a>]</span>that this has been established as a proved, and, I believe to most observers, an,
at first, astonishing fact. I well remember still the feeling of most curious interest
with which I regarded Knudsen’s translation of Luke’s Gospel (vol. i., No. 15 of your
Library), when, in April 1850, it was sent me by the then Inspector of the Rhenish
Mission House, the Rev J.&nbsp;C. Wallmann, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
language was in any way akin to those of the surrounding black nations, and whether,
on that account, an already acquired acquaintance with any of the Hottentot dialects
would render it easier for a Missionary to master one of the Negro or Kafir tongues.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e690src" href="#xd32e690">2</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e896">[<a href="#xd32e896">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>I had, however, at that time not the least idea of the results to which a knowledge
of this language <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e899">[<a href="#xd32e899">17</a>]</span>would lead me; and being then mostly occupied with the study of the Setshuâna and
kindred languages—which seemed to me of paramount interest for comparative philology—I
did not at first give undivided attention to the perusal of this curious volume. I
remarked very soon, however, a striking similarity between the Hottentot signs of
gender and those of the Coptic language; but for some time I considered it as purely
accidental, which may be seen from a letter of mine regarding this subject, published
by Mr. Wallmann, in “<span lang="de">Berichten der Rheinischen Missions-Gesellschaft</span>” <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e904">[<a href="#xd32e904">18</a>]</span>(Reports of the Rhenish Missionary Society, 1850, No. 24, if I am not mistaken in
the number).
</p>
<p>Soon, however, what were at first mere isolated facts, became links, in a chain of
evidence, showing that all those Sexdenoting Languages which were then known to us
in Africa, Asia, and Europe, are members of one large family, of which the primitive
type has, in most respects, been best preserved to us in the Hottentot language.
</p>
<p>It was even as early as the end of 1850 that I could write to Mr. Wallmann—“This language
(the Hottentot) is to me at this moment of greater interest than any other. The facts,
of which once before I have given you some account, have now so increased upon me,
and offer such strong analogies, that there is no further doubt in my own mind that
not only the Coptic but also the Semitic, and all other languages of Africa (as Berber,
the Galla dialect, &amp;c., &amp;c.) in which the distinction of the masculine and feminine
gender pervades the whole grammar, are of common origin.”
</p>
<p>Part of the result of these researches was then published in my dissertation, “<span lang="la">De Nominum Generibus Linguarum Africæ, Australis, Copticæ, Semiticarum <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e913">[<a href="#xd32e913">19</a>]</span>aliarumque Sexualium</span>” (8vo., Bonn, 6th August, 1851, vol. i., No. 1 of your Library).
</p>
<p>I was at that time not aware—nor has it come to my knowledge till within the last
few weeks—that on the 10th June, 1851, Dr. <span class="sc">J.&nbsp;C. Adamson</span>, in communicating to the Syro-Egyptian Society some observations on the analysis
of languages, with a special reference to those of South Africa, had stated “That
the signs of gender were almost identical in the Namaqua and the Egyptian, and the
feminine affix might be considered as being the same in all three”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e921src" href="#xd32e921">3</a> (Namaqua, Galla, and Old Egyptian).
</p>
<p>Another curious agreement on this point, by an apparently independent observer (Mr.
<span class="sc">J.&nbsp;R. Logan</span>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e929src" href="#xd32e929">4</a> <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e934">[<a href="#xd32e934">20</a>]</span>was pointed out to me by your Excellency. You also suggested this name of “Sexdenoting
Languages.” But it is superfluous for me to say any thing of what you have done for
the advancement of African, as well as Australian and Polynesian, philology.
</p>
<p>It has been justly remarked by our learned friend, Mr. <span class="sc">Justice Watermeyer</span>, that the natural propensities of animals in all parts of the world being so much
alike, Fables intended to portray them must also be expected to resemble each other
greatly, even to their very details.
</p>
<p>But we may well ask why it is that, so far as we know, the Kafir imagination seems
not at all inclined to the formation of this class of fictitious tales, though they
have otherwise a prolific Native literature of a more or less historic and legendary
character. This contrast to what we find among the Hottentots appears not to be accidental,
but merely a natural consequence of that difference of structure which distinguishes
these two classes of languages, embracing respectively the dialects of the Hottentots
on the one <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e943">[<a href="#xd32e943">21</a>]</span>hand, and those of the Kafirs and their kindred nations on the other; in the former
(the Hottentot), as in all other really Sexdenoting Languages, the grammatical divisions
of the nouns into genders, which do not tally exactly with any distinction observed
in nature, has been brought into a certain reference to the difference of sex; and
on that account this distinction of sex seems in some way to extend even to inanimate
beings, whereby a tendency to the personification of impersonal objects is produced,
which in itself is likely to lead the mind towards ascribing reason and other human
attributes to irrational beings. This is the real <span class="corr" id="xd32e945" title="Source: orgin">origin</span> of almost all those poetical conceptions which we call <i>Fables</i> and <i>Myths</i>. Both are based on the personification of impersonal beings—the former by ascribing
speech and reason to the lower animals, whilst the latter substitute human-like agencies
in explanation of celestial and other elementary phenomena in place of their real
cause.
</p>
<p>Mythology is, in its origin, most generally either a mere figure of speech or a poetical
explanation suggested by the grammatical form or etymological meaning of words, indicating
certain striking natural phenomena. In the primary stage of their production, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e954">[<a href="#xd32e954">22</a>]</span>Myths may be supposed to have been always understood in their true original character;
and it is only when in the course of generations their real origin has been obscured,
and they have become merely the petrified excrescences of a traditionary creed, that
their apparent absurdity makes them at first sight almost inexplicable, particularly
when found among nations of a high intelligence.
</p>
<p>The humbler sisters of the Myths, the Fables based on the natural propensities of
animals, are not obscured in their real character so easily as the former, and have,
on that account, more generally retained their simple usefulness as moral teachers;
so, though they may have preceded even Myths as to the date of their first conception,
they yet outlive them as real and salutary elements of the best national literatures:
not that Myths had not their own beneficial sphere in the education of mankind, as
leading them on to higher abstract ideas, and even deeper religious thoughts, but
their very power of exerting a much deeper influence on the destinies of our race,
made it essential that they should have a more transitory existence in the civilizing
process of the Sexdenoting nations—who have to give up mythologies so soon as through
them they have gained higher religious ideas—while <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e958">[<a href="#xd32e958">23</a>]</span>Fables, which never claim so high a place among the elements of furthering the eliminating
process of our species, remain always welcome to most classes of readers at certain
periods of their intellectual development.
</p>
<p>Children, and also simple-minded grown-up people, whose taste has not been spoiled
by the poison of over-exciting reading, will always be amused by the quaintly expressed
moral lessons which they receive through every good Fable; and the more thorough student
of literature will also regard with pleasure these first innocent plays of awakening
human imagination. To all these the Hottentot Fables offered here may not be unwelcome
as a fresh store of original compositions, or even as old acquaintances who gain a
new interest in different clothing and scenery.
</p>
<p>To make these Hottentot Fables readable for the general public, a few slight omissions
and alterations of what would otherwise have been too naked for the English eye were
necessary, but they do not in any essential way affect the spirit of the Fables. Otherwise,
the translation is faithful to the original, though not exactly literal.
</p>
<p>It would of course be presumptuous to believe that <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e964">[<a href="#xd32e964">24</a>]</span>we could here discuss fully the originality or date of composition of these Fables,
and all the many questions involved therein.
</p>
<p>The modern origin of some of the Fables, as, for instance, that of The Cock (12),
Fish-Stealing (8), The Judgment of the Baboon (17), and The Curse of the Horse (30),
is very evident; others, <i>e.g.</i>, The White Man and the Snake (5 &amp; 6), indicate clearly a European origin. Others,
however, have strong claims to be regarded not merely as genuine products of the Hottentot
mind, but even as portions of a traditionary Native literature, anterior in its origin
to the advent of Europeans.
</p>
<p>That the latter is a true view of the subject becomes perhaps the more conclusive
by the intimate relations in which, among the Hottentots, Myths still stand to Fables;
in fact, a true mythology can hardly be said to exist among them; for Myths (as that
of The Origin of Death) are in reality as much Fables as Myths; but we may consider
these as analogous to the first germs whence sprung those splendid mythologies which
have filled with deep devotional feelings the hearts of many millions among the most
intelligent races of the earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e973">[<a href="#xd32e973">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>This higher flight of the imaginative faculty which the Sexdenoting nations possess
(through the stimulus of this personification of impersonal things, consequent upon
the grammatical structure of their languages), and what it had been to them, becomes
the more evident if we compare their literature with that of the Kafirs and other
black tribes of South Africa.
</p>
<p>As the grammatical structure of languages spoken by the latter does not in itself
suggest personification, these nations are almost, as a matter of course, destitute
of Myths as well as Fables. Their literary efforts are, as a general rule, restricted
to narrating the doings of men in a more or less historical manner—whence we have
a number of household tales, and portions of a fabulous history of these tribes and
nations; or their ancestor worship and belief in the supernatural give rise to horrible
ghost stories and tales of witchcraft, which would be exciting if they were not generally
told in such a long-winded, prosy manner, as must make the best story lose its interest.
</p>
<p>Of course for the comparative philologist, and for any one who takes an interest in
observing the working of the human mind in its most primitive stages, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e978">[<a href="#xd32e978">26</a>]</span>these pieces of Kafir and Negro native literature will also have their own interest;
it is therefore to be hoped that time and circumstances may soon allow us to publish
also the other portions of South African native literature extant in manuscript in
your library.
</p>
<p>Among these we have principally to mention, as new contributions (received after your
departure), twenty-three pieces in o Tyi-hereró, or the Damara language, as written
down by natives themselves, copied by the Rev. <span class="sc">J. Rath</span> (Rhenish Missionary, formerly in Damara Land, now at Sarepta Knils River), and accompanied
with a German translation by him.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e985src" href="#xd32e985">5</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1092">[<a href="#xd32e1092">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among these pieces there are seven ghost stories, four accounts of transformation
of men or animals, eleven other household tales, one legend, and one fable. This last
piece (No. 11, pp. 27, 29) is probably of Hottentot origin. I have therefore thought
it best to give it a place in this little book (No. 14), where it precedes that Hottentot
Fable, to which its concluding <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1095">[<a href="#xd32e1095">28</a>]</span>portions bear such a striking resemblance. It is not unlikely that the beginning of
this Hottentot Fable of The Giraffe and the Tortoise is missing. It may have been
similar to the beginning of the corresponding one in Damara. As far as it goes the
Hottentot Fable is however evidently more original than the o Tyi-hereró text. As
a specimen of o Tyi-hereró household tales, I have given Rath’s fifteenth piece, the
story of The Unreasonable Child to whom the Dog gave its Deserts.
</p>
<p>You will also approve of my having added the Zulu legend of the Origin of Death, which
in its mixture of Fable and Myth, and even in several details of its composition,
shows a great analogy to the Hottentot treatment of the same subject, of which I am
able to give here four different versions.
</p>
<p>A second version of two or three other fables, and of one legend, has also been given
from one of the two important manuscripts in German, regarding the Hottentots and
their language, prepared for you by Mr. Knudsen.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1100src" href="#xd32e1100">6</a> The same manuscript <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1114">[<a href="#xd32e1114">29</a>]</span>supplied also a legend of The Origin of Difference in Modes of Life between Hottentots
and Bushmen, which we do not yet possess in the Hottentot language.
</p>
<p>To make our available stock of Nama Hottentot literature quite complete, three fables
and four tales <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1118">[<a href="#xd32e1118">30</a>]</span>have been taken from Sir James Alexander’s “Expedition,” &amp;c., and inserted here, with
only few insignificant verbal alterations.
</p>
<p>The “Songs of Praise,” given as notes to some of the Fables in this volume, are merely
intended as specimens of Hottentot poetry. They can hardly be expected to amuse or
interest the general reader—at least, not in the form in which they appear here, though
a Longfellow might be able to render some of them in a way that would make them attractive.
</p>
<p>In the same manner the materials contained in these Hottentot Fables might be worked
out similarly to Goethe’s “<span lang="de">Reinecke Fuchs</span>;” and we should hereby probably gain an epical composition, which, though not ranking
so high as the latter poem, would yet, as regards the interest of its subject-matter,
far exceed Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” in adaptation to the general taste.
</p>
<p>How much Native productions gain when represented skilfully and properly, your admirable
work on “Polynesian Mythology” has shown. But you had sterner and more important work
on hand, and so I have had to do this without you. That it does not appear in a still
more imperfect form, I owe <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1129">[<a href="#xd32e1129">31</a>]</span>mainly to the help of one who naturally takes the greatest interest in all my pursuits.
</p>
<p>In writing the last lines of this Preface, the interest which I feel for these Hottentot
Fables is almost fading away before those rich treasures of your library which have
just arrived from England; and as all our present efforts are of course given to the
proper settling of these jewels of our library, I can merely send, with grateful acknowledgments,
our most fervent wishes for your well-doing, and our sincere hope of seeing you, at
no distant day, again in the midst of us.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd32e690src">2</a></span> I give here some extracts from Mr. Wallmann’s letter, dated Barmen, 13th April, 1850,
which was the only help of a grammatical or lexical nature then available for me in
my study of this Nama translation of Luke’s Gospel:—
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“I transmit hereby Luke’s Gospel in Namaqua, … which I can lend you, however, only
for four weeks, as I have already previously promised it to some one else.
</p>
<p class="footnote cont">“Should your labours permit it, I wish to request you to make a little trial whether
the Namaqua is somewhat related to the South African family of Languages. For the
present a mere <i>negative</i> decision on this point is all that is wanted, and I should like to have very soon
the opinion of some good philologist regarding it. Moffat <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e697">[<a href="#xd32e697">16</a>]</span>states that when he gave specimens of Namaqua to a Syrian who came from Egypt, he
was told that he (the Syrian) had seen slaves in the market of Cairo who were of lighter
colour than other Africans, and whose language resembled that of the Namaqua. Moffat
also says that some ancient authors have mentioned a nation in the interior of Africa
who were very similar to the Hottentots. Moffat seems himself, however, to ascribe
little value to these accounts, for his guesses fall at once upon the Chinese. According
to communications from our Missionary Knudsen, the Namaqua language seems well formed.
He mentions as personal pronouns:—

<p>The wild animals, it is said, were once assembled at the Lion’s. When the Lion was
asleep, the Jackal persuaded the little Fox<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1158src" href="#xd32e1158">1</a> to twist a rope of ostrich sinews, in order to play the Lion a trick. They took ostrich
sinews, twisted them, and fastened the rope to the Lion’s tail, and the other end
of the rope they tied to a shrub. When the Lion awoke, and saw that he was tied up,
he became angry, and called the animals together. When they had assembled, he said
(using this form of conjuration)—
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1173">[<a href="#xd32e1173">34</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“What child of his mother and father’s love,
</p>
<p class="line">Whose mother and father’s love has tied me?”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then answered the animal to whom the question was first put—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I, child of my mother and father’s love,
</p>
<p class="line">I, mother and father’s love, I have not done it.”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">All answered the same; but when he asked the little Fox, the little Fox said—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I, child of my mother and father’s love,
</p>
<p class="line">I, mother and father’s love, have tied thee!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then the Lion tore the rope made of sinews, and ran after the little Fox. But the
Jackal said—
</p>
<p>“My boy, thou son of the lean Mrs. Fox, thou wilt never be caught.”
</p>
<p>Truly the Lion was thus beaten in running by the little Fox.

<p>The Lion and the Jackal, it is said, were one day lying in wait for elands. The Lion
shot (with the bow) and missed, but the Jackal hit and sang out, “Hah! Hah!” The Lion
said, “No, you did not shoot anything. It was I who hit.” The Jackal answered, “Yea,
my father, thou hast hit.” Then they went home in order to return when the eland was
dead, and cut it up. The Jackal, however, turned back, unknown to the Lion, hit his
nose so that the blood ran on the spoor of the elands, and followed their track thus,
in order to cheat the Lion. When he had gone some distance, he returned by another
way to the dead eland, and creeping into its carcase, cut out all the fat.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Lion followed the bloodstained spoor of the Jackal, thinking that it
was elands’ blood, and only when he had gone some distance did he find out that he
had been deceived. He then returned on the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1197">[<a href="#xd32e1197">36</a>]</span>Jackal’s spoor, and reached the dead eland, where, finding the Jackal in its carcase,
he seized him by his tail and drew him out with a swing.
</p>
<p>The Lion upbraided the Jackal with these words: “Why do you cheat me?” The Jackal
answered: “No, my father, I do not cheat you; you may know it, I think. I prepared
this fat for you, father.” The Lion said: “Then take the fat and bring it to your
mother” (the Lioness); and he gave him the lungs to take to his own wife and children.
</p>
<p>When the Jackal arrived, he did not give the fat to the Lion’s wife, but to his own
wife and children; he gave, however, the lungs to the Lion’s wife, and he pelted the
Lion’s little children with the lungs, saying:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“You children of the big-pawed one!

</p>
<p>The Lion and the Jackal went together a-hunting. They shot with arrows. The Lion shot
first, but his arrow fell short of its aim; but the Jackal hit the game, and joyfully
cried out, “It has hit.” The Lion looked at him with his two large eyes; the Jackal,
however, did not lose his countenance, but said, “No, Uncle, I mean to say that you
have hit.” Then they followed the game, and the Jackal passed the arrow of the Lion
without drawing the latter’s attention to it. When they arrived at a cross-way, the
Jackal said, “Dear Uncle, you are old and tired; stay here.” The Jackal went then
on a wrong track, beat his nose, and, in returning, let the blood drop from it like
traces of game. “I could not find anything,” he said, “but I met with traces of blood.
You had better go yourself to look for it. In the meantime I shall go this other way.”
The Jackal soon found the killed animal, crept inside of it, and devoured the best
portion; <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1213">[<a href="#xd32e1213">38</a>]</span>but his tail remained outside, and when the Lion arrived, he got hold of it, pulled
the Jackal out, and threw him on the ground with these words: “You rascal!” The Jackal
rose quickly again, complained of the rough handling, and asked, “What have I then
now done, dear Uncle? I was busy cutting out the best part.” “Now let us go and fetch
our wives,” said the Lion; but the Jackal entreated his dear Uncle to remain at the
place because he was old. The Jackal went then away, taking with him two portions
of the flesh, one for his own wife, but the best part for the wife of the Lion. When
the Jackal arrived with the flesh, the children of the Lion saw him, began to jump,
and clapping their hands, cried out, “There comes Uncle with flesh!” The Jackal threw,
grumbling, the worst portion to them, and said, “There, you brood of the big-eyed
one!” Then he went to his own house and told his wife immediately to break up the
house, and to go where the killed game was. The Lioness wished to do the same, but
he forbade her, and said that the Lion would himself come to fetch her.
</p>
<p>When the Jackal, with his wife and children, had arrived in the neighbourhood of the
killed animal, he ran into a thorn bush, scratched his face so that it bled, and thus
made his appearance before the Lion, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1217">[<a href="#xd32e1217">39</a>]</span>to whom he said, “Ah! what a wife you have got. Look here, how she scratched my face
when I told her that she should come with us. You must fetch her yourself; I cannot
bring her.” The Lion went home very angry. Then the Jackal said, “Quick, let us build
a tower.” They heaped stone upon stone, stone upon stone, stone upon stone; and when
it was high enough, everything was carried to the top of it. When the Jackal saw the
Lion approaching with his wife and children, he cried out to him, “Uncle, whilst you
were away we have built a tower, in order to be better able to see game.” “All right,”
said the Lion; “but let me come up to you.” “Certainly, dear Uncle; but how will you
manage to come up? We must let down a thong for you.” The Lion ties himself to the
thong, and is drawn up; but when he is nearly at the top the thong is cut by the Jackal,
who exclaims, as if frightened, “Oh, how heavy you are, Uncle! Go, wife, fetch me
a new thong.” (“An old one,” he said aside to her.) The Lion is again drawn up, but
comes of course down in the same manner. “No,” said the Jackal, “that will never do;
you must, however, manage to come up high enough, so that you may get a mouthful at
least.<span class="corr" id="xd32e1219" title="Not in source">”</span> Then aloud he orders his wife to prepare a good piece, but aside he tells her to
make a <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1221">[<a href="#xd32e1221">40</a>]</span>stone hot, and to cover it with fat. Then he drew up the Lion once more, and, complaining
that he is very heavy to hold, he tells him to open his mouth, whereupon he throws
the hot stone down his throat. When the Lion has devoured it, he entreats and requests
him to run as quickly as possible to the water.

<p>The Jackal, it is said, married the Hyena, and carried off a cow belonging to ants,
to slaughter her for the wedding; and when he had slaughtered her, he put the cow-skin
over his bride; and when he had fixed a pole (on which to hang the flesh), he placed
on the top of the pole (which was forked) the hearth for cooking, in order to cook
upon it all sorts of delicious food. There came also the Lion to the spot, and wished
to go up. The Jackal, therefore, asked his little daughter for a thong with which
he could pull the Lion up, and he began to pull him up; and when his face came near
to the cooking-pot, he cut the thong in two, so that the Lion tumbled down. Then the
Jackal upbraided his little daughter with these words: “Why do you give me such an
old thong?” And he added, “Give me a fresh thong.” She gave him a new thong, and he
pulled the Lion up again, and when his face came near the pot, which stood on <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1230">[<a href="#xd32e1230">42</a>]</span>the fire, he said, “Open your mouth.” Then he put into his mouth a hot piece of quartz
which had been boiled together with the fat, and the stone went down, burning his
throat. Thus died the Lion.
</p>
<p>There came also the ants running after the cow, and when the Jackal saw them he fled.
Then they beat the bride in her brookaross dress. The Hyena, believing that it was
the Jackal, said—
</p>

<p>A White Man, it is said, met a Snake upon whom a large stone had fallen and covered
her, so that she could not rise. The White Man lifted the stone off the Snake, but
when he had done so, she wanted to bite him. The White Man said, “Stop! let us both
go first to some wise people.” They went to the Hyena, and the White Man asked him,
“Is it right that the Snake should want to bite me, though I helped her, when she
lay under a stone and could not rise?”
</p>
<p>The Hyena (who thought he would get his share of the White Man’s body) said: “If you
were bitten what would it matter?”
</p>
<p>Then the Snake wanted to bite him, but the White Man said again: “Wait a little, and
let us go to other wise people, that I may hear whether this is right.”
</p>
<p>They went and met the Jackal. The White Man said to the Jackal: “Is it right that
the Snake wants <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1247">[<a href="#xd32e1247">44</a>]</span>to bite me, though I lifted up the stone which lay upon her?”
</p>
<p>The Jackal replied: “I do not believe that the Snake could be covered by a stone and
could not rise. Unless I saw it with my two eyes, I would not believe it. Therefore,
come let us go and see at the place where you say it happened whether it can be true.”
</p>
<p>They went, and arrived at the place where it had happened. The Jackal said: “Snake,
lie down, and let thyself be covered.”
</p>
<p>The Snake did so, and the White Man covered her with the stone; but although she exerted
herself very much, she could not rise. Then the White Man wanted again to release
the Snake, but the Jackal interfered, and said: “Do not lift the stone. She wanted
to bite you; therefore she may rise by herself.”
</p>
<p>Then they both went away and left the Snake under the stone.

<p>“Now let us at last ask the Jackal,” said the Man in his despair.
</p>
<p>The Jackal answered very slowly and considerately, doubting the whole affair, and
demanding to see first the place, and whether the Man was able to lift the stone.
The Snake lay down, and the Man, to prove the truth of his account, put the stone
again over her.
</p>
<p>When she was fast, the Jackal said, “Now let her lie there.”

ascended upon it, and ate of the cloud as if it were fat.
</p>
<p>When he wanted to come down, he said to the Hyena, “My sister, as I am going to divide
with <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1294">[<a href="#xd32e1294">47</a>]</span>thee, catch me well.” So she caught him, and broke his fall. Then she also went up

rogue said to his friend, “My sister, I shall catch thee well. Come therefore down.”

<p>He held up his hands, and she came down from the cloud, and when she was near, the
Jackal cried out (painfully jumping to one side), “My sister, do not take it ill.
Oh me! oh me! A thorn has pricked me, and sticks in me.” Thus she fell down from above,
and was sadly hurt.

<p>Once upon a time a Jackal, who lived on the borders of the colony, saw a waggon returning
from the seaside laden with fish. He tried to get into the waggon from behind, but
he could not; he then ran on before, and lay in the road as if dead. The waggon came
up to him, and the leader cried to the driver, “Here is a fine kaross for your wife!”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1320">[<a href="#xd32e1320">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Throw it into the waggon,” said the driver, and the Jackal was thrown in.
</p>
<p>The waggon travelled on through a moonlight night, and all the while the Jackal was
throwing the fish out into the road; he then jumped out himself, and secured a great
prize. But a stupid old Hyena coming by, ate more than her share, for which the Jackal
owed her a grudge; so he said to her, “You can get plenty of fish, too, if you lie
in the way of a waggon as I did, and keep quite still whatever happens.”
</p>
<p>“So!” mumbled the Hyena.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the next waggon came from the sea, the Hyena stretched herself out
in the road.
</p>
<p>“What ugly thing is this?” cried the leader, and kicked the Hyena. He then took a
stick and thrashed her within an inch of her life. The Hyena, according to the directions
of the Jackal, lay quiet as long as she could; she then got up and hobbled off to
tell her misfortune to the Jackal, who pretended to comfort her.
</p>
<p>“What a pity,” said the Hyena, “that I have not such a handsome skin as you!”

<p>The Lion asked the Jackal: “Why did you not come here to see me?” The Jackal said,
“Oh no! when I heard that my uncle was so very ill, I went to the witch (doctor),
to consult him, whether and what medicine would be good for my uncle against the pain.
The doctor said to me, ‘Go and tell your uncle to take hold of the Hyena and draw
off her skin, and put it on while it is still warm. Then he <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1350">[<a href="#xd32e1350">52</a>]</span>will recover.’ The Hyena is one who does not care for my uncle’s sufferings.”

Then she threw one down to him.

<p>He came back another day, and demanded another little child, and she gave it to him.
After the Jackal had gone, the Heron came, and asked, “Dove, why do you cry?” The
dove answered him: “The Jackal has taken away my little children; it is for this that
I cry.” He asked her, “In what manner can he take them?” She answered him: “When he
asked me I refused him; but when he said, ‘I shall at once fly up, therefore give
it me,’ I threw it down to him.” The Heron said, “Are you such a fool as to give your

asked, “In what manner does he pray? Tell me.” “He folds his hands in praying,” said
the Cock. The Jackal folded his hands and prayed. Then the Cock spoke again: “You
ought not to look about you as you do. You had better shut your eyes.” He did so;
and the Cock flew away, upbraiding at the same time the Jackal with these words: “You
rogue! do you also pray?”
</p>
<p>There sat the Jackal, speechless, because he had been outdone.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">(From Sir James E. Alexander’s “Expedition of Discovery into the Interior of Africa,”
vol. ii. pp. 247, 250.)
</p>
<p>A Leopard was returning home from hunting on one occasion, when he lighted on the
kraal of a Ram. Now the Leopard had never seen a Ram before, and accordingly, approaching
submissively, he said, “Good day, friend! what may your name be?”
</p>
<p>The other, in his gruff voice, and striking his breast with his forefoot, said, “I
am a Ram. Who are you?”
</p>
<p>“A Leopard,” answered the other, more dead than alive; and then, taking leave of the
Ram, he ran home as fast as he could.
</p>
<p>A Jackal lived at the same place as the Leopard did, and the latter going to him,
said, “Friend Jackal, I am quite out of breath, and am half dead with fright, for
I have just seen a terrible-looking fellow, with a large and thick head, and, on my
asking him what his name was, he answered roughly, “I am a Ram!”
</p>
<p>“What a foolish Leopard you are!” cried the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1387">[<a href="#xd32e1387">57</a>]</span>Jackal, to let such a nice piece of flesh stand! “Why did you do so? But we shall
go to-morrow and eat it together!”
</p>
<p>Next day the two set off for the kraal of the Ram, and as they appeared over a hill,
the Ram, who had turned out to look about him, and was calculating where he should
that day crop a tender salad, saw them, and he immediately went to his wife, and said,
“I fear this is our last day, for the Jackal and Leopard are both coming against us.
What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said the wife, “but take up the child in your arms; go out with
it, and pinch it to make it cry as if it were hungry.” The Ram did so as the confederates
came on.
</p>
<p>No sooner did the Leopard cast his eyes on the Ram, than fear again took possession
of him, and he wished to turn back. The Jackal had provided against this, and made
the Leopard fast to himself with a leathern thong, and said, “Come on!” when the Ram
cried in a loud voice, and pinching his child at the same time, “You have done well,
friend Jackal, to have brought us the Leopard to eat, for you hear how my child is
crying for food!”
</p>
<p>On hearing these dreadful words, the Leopard, notwithstanding the entreaties of the
Jackal to let him loose, set off in the greatest alarm, dragging the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1394">[<a href="#xd32e1394">58</a>]</span>Jackal after him over hill and valley, through bushes and over rocks, and never stopped
to look behind him till he brought back himself and the half-dead Jackal to his place
again. And so the Ram escaped.

<p>Two things, the Elephant and the Rain, had a dispute. The Elephant said, “If you say
that you nourish me, in what way is it that you do so?” The Rain answered, “If you
say that I do not nourish you, when I go away, will you not die?” And the Rain then
departed.
</p>
<p>The Elephant said, “Vulture! cast lots to make <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1414">[<a href="#xd32e1414">60</a>]</span>rain for me?” The Vulture said, “I will not cast lots.”
</p>
<p>Then the Elephant said to the Crow, “Cast lots!” who answered, “Give the things with
which I may cast lots.” The Crow cast lots and rain fell. It rained at the lagoons,
but they dried up, and only one lagoon remained.
</p>
<p>The Elephant went a-hunting. There was, however, the Tortoise, to whom the Elephant
said, “Tortoise, remain at the water!” Thus the Tortoise was left behind when the
Elephant went a-hunting.
</p>
<p>There came the Giraffe, and said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise answered,
“The water belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Zebra, who said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise answered,
“The water belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Gemsbok, and said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise answered,
“The water belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Wildebeest, and said, “Give me water!” The Tortoise said, “The water
belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Roodebok, and said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise answered,
“The water belongs to the Elephant.”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1424">[<a href="#xd32e1424">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>There came the Springbok, and said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise
said, “The water belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Jackal, and said to the Tortoise, “Give me water!” The Tortoise said,
“The water belongs to the Elephant.”
</p>
<p>There came the Lion, and said, “Little Tortoise, give me water!” When the little Tortoise
was about to say something, the Lion got hold of it and beat it; the Lion drank of
the water, and since then the animals drink water.
</p>
<p>When the Elephant came back from the hunting, he said, “Little Tortoise, is there
water?” The Tortoise answered, “The animals have drunk the water.” The Elephant asked,
“Little Tortoise, shall I chew you or swallow you down?” The little Tortoise said,
“Swallow me, if you please;” and the Elephant swallowed it whole.
</p>
<p>After the Elephant had swallowed the little Tortoise, and it had entered his body,
it tore off his liver, heart, and kidneys. The Elephant said, “Little Tortoise, you
kill me.”
</p>
<p>So the Elephant died; but the little Tortoise came out of his dead body, and went
wherever it liked.

<p>The Giraffe and the Tortoise, they say, met one day. The Giraffe said to the Tortoise,
“At once I could trample you to death.” The Tortoise, being afraid, remained silent.
Then the Giraffe said, “At once I could swallow you.” The Tortoise said, in answer
to this, “Well, I just belong to the family of those whom it has always been customary
to swallow.” Then the Giraffe swallowed the Tortoise; but when the latter was being
gulped down, it stuck in the Giraffe’s throat, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1457">[<a href="#xd32e1457">63</a>]</span>and as the latter could not get it down, he was choked to death.

<p>One day, it is said, the Tortoises held a council how they might hunt Ostriches, and
they said, “Let us, on both sides, stand in rows near each other, and let one go to
hunt the Ostriches, so that they must flee along through the midst of us.” They did
so, and as they were many, the Ostriches were obliged to run along through the midst
of them. During this they did not move, but, remaining always in the same places,
called each to the other, “Are you there?” and each one answered, “I am here.” The
Ostriches hearing this, ran so tremendously that they quite exhausted their strength,
and fell down. Then the Tortoises assembled by-and-by at the place where the Ostriches
had fallen, and devoured them.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">(The original, in the Hottentot language, of this little Namaqualand Fable, is in
Sir G. Grey’s Library, G. Krönlein’s Manuscript, pp. 33, 35.)
</p>
<p>One day, it is said, the following story happened. The Mouse had torn the clothes
of Itkler (the tailor), <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1509">[<a href="#xd32e1509">66</a>]</span>who then went to the Baboon, and accused the Mouse with these words:—
</p>
<p>“In this manner I come to thee:—The Mouse has torn my clothes, but will not know anything
of it, and accuses the Cat; the Cat protests likewise her innocence, and says the
Dog must have done it; but the Dog denies it also, and declares the Wood has done
it; and the Wood throws the blame on the Fire, and says, ‘The Fire did it;’ the Fire
says, ‘<i>I</i> have not, the Water did it;’ the Water says, ‘The Elephant tore the clothes;’ and
the Elephant says, ‘The Ant tore them.’ Thus a dispute has arisen among them. Therefore
I, Itkler, come to thee with this proposition: Assemble the people and try them, in
order that I may get satisfaction.”
</p>
<p>Thus he spake, and the Baboon assembled them for trial. Then they made the same excuses
which had been mentioned by Itkler, each one putting the blame upon the other.
</p>
<p>So the Baboon did not see any other way of punishing them, save through making them
punish each other; he therefore said—
</p>
<p>“Mouse, give Itkler satisfaction.”
</p>
<p>The Mouse, however, pleaded not guilty. But the Baboon said, “Cat, bite the Mouse.”
She did so.
</p>
<p>He then put the same question to the Cat, and when <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1521">[<a href="#xd32e1521">67</a>]</span>she exculpated herself, the Baboon called to the Dog, “Here, bite the Cat.”
</p>
<p>In this manner the Baboon questioned them all, one after the other, but they each
denied the charge. Then he addressed the following words to them, and said—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Wood, beat the Dog.
</p>
<p class="line">Fire, burn the Wood.
</p>
<p class="line">Water, quench the Fire.
</p>
<p class="line">Elephant, drink the Water.</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd32e1531" title="Not in source">“</span>Ant, bite the Elephant in his most tender parts.”
</p>
<p>They did so, and since that day they cannot any longer agree with each other.
</p>
<p>The Ant enters into the Elephant’s most tender parts, and bites him.
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Elephant swallows the Water.
</p>
<p class="line">The Water quenches the Fire.
</p>
<p class="line">The Fire consumes the Wood.
</p>
<p class="line">The Wood beats the Dog.
</p>
<p class="line">The Dog bites the Cat.
</p>
<p class="line">And the Cat the Mouse.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Through this judgment Itkler got satisfaction, and addressed the Baboon in the following
manner:— “Yes! Now I am content, since I have received satisfaction, and with all
my heart I thank thee, Baboon, because thou hast exercised justice on my behalf, and
given me redress.”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1544">[<a href="#xd32e1544">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Baboon said, “From to-day I will not any longer be called Jan, but Baboon
shall be my name.”
</p>
<p>Since that time the Baboon walks on all fours, having probably lost the privilege
of walking erect through this foolish judgment.(?)

plates on the back of his head. When, therefore, the Lion crept upon him, he thought,
when the Baboon was looking at him, that he sat with his back towards him, and crept
with all his might upon him. When, however, the Baboon turned his back towards him,
the Lion thought that he was seen, and hid himself. Thus, when the <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1569">[<a href="#xd32e1569">70</a>]</span>Baboon looked at him, he crept upon him. Whilst the Baboon did this, the Lion came
close upon him. When he was near him the Baboon looked up, and the Lion continued
to creep upon him. The Baboon said (aside), “Whilst I am looking at him he steals
upon me, whilst my hollow eyes are on him.”
</p>
<p>When at last the Lion sprung at him, he lay (quickly) down upon his face, and the
Lion jumped over him, falling down the precipice, and was dashed to pieces.

Mares became the mother of a foal. The others then helped her to suckle (the young
stallion), that he might soon grow up.
</p>
<p>When he was grown up, and they were in want of water, they brought him to the water.
The Baboons, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1597">[<a href="#xd32e1597">72</a>]</span>seeing this, came, as they formerly were used to do, into their way, and kept them

Baboons, “Thou gum-eater’s child!”

<p>The Baboon said to the Stallion, “Please open thy mouth, that I may see what thou

<p>Then the Stallion said to the Baboon, “Please open thy mouth also, that I may see.”
The Baboon did so, and there was some gum in it. But the Baboon quickly licked some
milk off the Stallion’s tongue. The Stallion on this became angry, took the Baboon
by his shoulders, and pressed him upon a hot, flat rock. Since that day the Baboon
has a bald place on his back.

<p>The children belonging to a kraal were playing at some little distance from the huts
with bows and arrows; in the evening they all returned home, save one, a boy of five
or six years old, who lingered behind, and was soon surrounded by a troop of baboons,
who carried him up a mountain.
</p>
<p>The people turned out to recover the boy, and for days they hunted after him in vain;
he was nowhere to be seen; the baboons also had left the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>A year after this had occurred, a mounted hunter came to the kraal from a distance,
and told the people that he had crossed at such a place the spoor of baboons, along
with the footmarks of a child. The people went to the place which the hunter had indicated,
and they soon saw what they were in search of, viz., the boy, sitting on a pinnacle
of rock, in company with a large baboon. The moment the people <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1636">[<a href="#xd32e1636">75</a>]</span>approached, the baboon took up the boy, and scampered off with him; but, after a close
pursuit, the boy was recovered. He seemed quite wild, and tried to run away to the
baboons again; however, he was brought back to the kraal, and when he recovered his

and spiders themselves, but brought him roots, gum, and wild raisins, seeing that
he did not touch the two first-named delicacies, and that they always allowed him
to drink first at the waters.

<p>The Namaquas say that, not long ago, a man had brought up a young Baboon, and had
made it his shepherd. It remained by the flock all day in the field, and at night
drove them home to the kraal, riding on the back of one of the goats, which brought
up the rear. The Baboon had the milk of one goat allowed to it, and it sucked that
one only, and guarded the milk of the others from the children. It also got a little
meat from its master. It held the office of shepherd for twelve moons, and then was
unfortunately killed in a tree by a Leopard.

</p>
<p>The Lion, it is said, used once to fly, and at that time nothing could live before
him. As he was unwilling that the bones of what he caught should be broken into pieces,
he made a pair of White Crows watch the bones, leaving them behind at the kraal whilst
he went a-hunting. But one day the great Frog came there, broke the bones in pieces,
and said, “Why can men and animals live no longer?” And he added these words, “When
he comes, tell him that I live at yonder pool; if he wishes to see me, he must come
there.”
</p>
<p>The Lion, lying in wait (for game), wanted to fly up, but found he could not fly.
Then he got angry, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1661">[<a href="#xd32e1661">78</a>]</span>thinking that at the kraal something was wrong, and returned home. When he arrived,
he asked, “What have you done that I cannot fly?” Then they answered and said, “Some
one came here, broke the bones into pieces, and said, ‘If he wants me, he may look
for me at yonder pool!’ ” The Lion went, and arrived while the Frog was sitting at
the water’s edge, and he tried to creep stealthily upon him. When he was about to
get hold of him, the Frog said, “Ho!” and, diving, went to the other side of the pool,
and sat there. The Lion pursued him; but as he could not catch him he returned home.
</p>
<p>From that day, it is said, the Lion walked on his feet, and also began to creep upon
(his game); and the White Crows became entirely dumb since the day that they said,
“Nothing can be said of that matter.”

<p>It is said that when the Lion and <i lang="naq">ǀgurikhoisip</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1674src" href="#xd32e1674">1</a> (the Only man), together with the Baboon, the Buffalo, and other friends, were playing
one day at a certain game, there was a thunderstorm and rain at <i lang="naq">ǂaroχaams</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1682src" href="#xd32e1682">2</a> The Lion and <i lang="naq">ǀgurikhoisip</i> began to quarrel. “I shall run to the rain-field,” said the Lion. <i lang="naq">ǀGurikhoisip</i> said also, “I shall run to the rain-field.” As neither would concede this to the
other, they separated (angrily). After they had parted, the Lion went to tell his
Mother those things which they had both said.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1694">[<a href="#xd32e1694">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>His Mother said to him, “My Father! that Man whose head is in a line with his shoulders
and breast, who has pinching weapons, who keeps white dogs, who goes about wearing
the tuft of a tiger’s tail, beware of him!” The Lion, however, said, “Why need I be
on my guard against those whom I know?” The Lioness answered, “My Son, take care of
him who has pinching weapons!” But the Lion would not follow his Mother’s advice,
and the same morning, when it was still pitch dark, he went to <i lang="naq">ǂaroχaams</i>, and laid himself in ambush. <i lang="naq">ǀGurikhoisip</i> went also that morning to the same place. When he had arrived he let his dogs drink,
and then bathe. After they had finished they wallowed. Then also the man drank; and,
when he had done drinking, the Lion came out of the bush. The dogs surrounded him,
as his mother had foretold, and he was speared by <i lang="naq">ǀgurikhoisip</i>. Just as he became aware that he was speared, the dogs drew him down again. In this
manner he grew faint. While he was in this state, <i lang="naq">ǀgurikhoisip</i> said to the dogs, “Let him alone now, that he may go and be taught by his Mother.”
So the dogs let him go. They left him, and went home as he lay there. The same night
he walked towards home, but whilst he was on the way his strength failed him, and
he lamented:

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">(The original, in the Hottentot language, is in Sir G. Grey’s Library, G. Krönlein’s
Manuscript, pp. 60, 65.)
</p>
<p>Some women, it is said, went out to seek roots and herbs and other wild food. On their
way home they sat down and said, “Let us taste the food of the field.” Now they found
that the food picked by one of them was sweet, while that of the others was bitter.
The latter said to each other, “Look here! this woman’s herbs are sweet.” Then they
said to the owner of the sweet food, “Throw it away and seek for other”—(sweet-tasted
herbs being apparently unpalatable to the Hottentot). So she threw away the food,
and went to gather more. When she had collected a sufficient supply, she returned
to join the other women, but could not find them. She went therefore down to the river,
where the Hare sat lading water, and said to him, “Hare, give me some water that I
may drink.” But he replied, “This is the cup out of which my uncle (the Lion) and
I alone may drink.”
</p>
<p>She asked again: “Hare, draw water for me that <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1739">[<a href="#xd32e1739">83</a>]</span>I may drink.” But the Hare made the same reply. Then she snatched the cup from him
and drank, but he ran home to tell his uncle of the outrage which had been committed.
</p>
<p>The Woman meanwhile replaced the cup and went away. After she had departed the Lion
came down, and, seeing her in the distance, pursued her on the road. When she turned
round and saw him coming, she sang in the following manner:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My mother, she would not let me seek herbs,
</p>
<p class="line">Herbs of the field, food from the field. Hoo!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the Lion at last came up with the Woman, they hunted each other round a shrub.
She wore many beads and arm-rings, and the Lion said, “Let me put them on!” So she
lent them to him, but he afterwards refused to return them to her.
</p>
<p>They then hunted each other again round the shrub, till the Lion fell down, and the
Woman jumped upon him, and kept him there. The Lion (uttering a form of conjuration)
said:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1749">Pray, rise from me!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She then rose from him, and they hunted again after each other round the shrub, till
the Woman fell down, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1753">[<a href="#xd32e1753">84</a>]</span>and the Lion jumped upon her. She then addressed him:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My Uncle! it is morning, and time to rise;
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1749">Pray, rise from me!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He rose, of course, and they hunted each other again, till the Lion fell a second
time. When she jumped upon him, he said:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;
</p>
<p class="line xd32e1749">Pray, rise from me!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">They rose again and hunted after each other. The Woman at last fell down. But this
time, when she repeated the above conjuration, the Lion said:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Hè Kha! <i>Is</i> it morning, and time to rise?”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He then ate her, taking care, however, to leave her skin whole, which he put on, together
with her dress and ornaments, so that he looked quite like a woman, and then went
home to her kraal.
</p>
<p>When this counterfeit woman arrived, her little sister, crying, said, “My sister,
pour some milk out for me.” She answered, “I shall not pour you out any.” Then the
child addressed their Mother: “Mama, do pour out some for me.” The Mother of the kraal
said, “Go to your sister, and let her give <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1777">[<a href="#xd32e1777">85</a>]</span>it to you!” The little child said again to her sister, “Please, pour out for me!”
She, however, repeated her refusal, saying, “I will not do it.” Then the Mother of
the kraal said to the little one, “I refused to let her (the elder sister) seek herbs
in the field, and I do not know what may have happened; go therefore to the Hare,
and ask him to pour out for you.”
</p>
<p>So the Hare gave her some milk; but her elder sister said, “Come and share it with
me.” The little child then went to her sister with her bamboo (cup), and they both
sucked the milk out of it. Whilst they were doing this, some milk was spilt on the
little one’s hand, and the elder sister licked it up with her tongue, the roughness
of which drew blood; this, too, the Woman licked up.
</p>
<p>The little child complained to her Mother: “Mama, sister pricks holes in me, and sucks
the blood.” The Mother said, “With what lion’s nature your sister went the way that
I forbade her, and returned, I do not know.”
</p>
<p>Now the cows arrived, and the elder sister cleansed the pails in order to milk them.
But when she approached the cows with a thong (in order to tie their fore-legs), they
all refused to be milked by her.
</p>
<p>The Hare said, “Why do not you stand before the cow?” She replied, “Hare, call your
brother, and <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1784">[<a href="#xd32e1784">86</a>]</span>do you two stand before the cow.” Her husband said, “What has come over her that the
cows refuse her? These are the same cows she always milks.” The Mother (of the kraal)
said, “What has happened this evening? These are cows which she always milks without
assistance. What can have affected her that she comes home as a woman with a lion’s
nature?”
</p>
<p>The elder daughter then said to her Mother, “I shall not milk the cows.” With these
words she sat down. The Mother said therefore to the Hare, “Bring me the bamboos,
that I may milk. I do not know what has come over the girl.”
</p>
<p>So the Mother herself milked the cows, and when she had done so, the Hare brought
the bamboos to the young wife’s house, where her husband was, but she (the wife) did
not give him (her husband) anything to eat. But when at night time she fell asleep,
they saw some of the Lion’s hair, which was hanging out where he had slipped on the
woman’s skin, and they cried, “Verily! this is quite another being. It is for this
reason that the cows refused to be milked.”
</p>
<p>Then the people of the kraal began to break up the hut in which the Lion lay asleep.
When they took off the mats, they said (conjuring them), “If thou art favourably inclined
to me, O mat, give the sound ‘<i lang="naq">sawa</i>’ ” (meaning, making no noise).
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1794">[<a href="#xd32e1794">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>To the poles (on which the hut rested) they said, “If thou art favourably inclined
to me, O pole, thou must give the sound <i lang="naq">ǂgara</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1800src" href="#xd32e1800">3</a>
</p>
<p>They addressed also the bamboos and the bed-skins in a similar manner.
</p>
<p>Thus gradually and noiselessly they removed the hut and all its contents. Then they
took bunches of grass, put them over the Lion, and lighting them, said, “If thou art
favourably inclined to me, O fire, thou must flare up, ‘<i>boo boo</i>,’ before thou comest to the heart.”
</p>
<p>So the fire flared up when it came towards the heart, and the heart of the Woman jumped
upon the ground. The Mother (of the kraal) picked it up, and put it into a calabash.
</p>
<p>The Lion, from his place in the fire, said to the Mother (of the kraal), “How nicely
I have eaten your daughter.” The Woman answered, “You have also now a comfortable
place!” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
</p>
<p>Now the Woman took the first milk of as many cows as calved, and put it into the calabash
where her daughter’s heart was; the calabash increased in size, and in proportion
to this the girl grew again inside it.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1812">[<a href="#xd32e1812">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day, when the Mother (of the kraal) went out to fetch wood, she said to the Hare,
“By the time that I come back you must have everything nice and clean.” But during
her Mother’s absence, the girl crept out of the calabash, and put the hut in good
order, as she had been used to do in former days, and said to the Hare, “When mother
comes back and asks, ‘Who has done these things?’ you must say, ‘I, the Hare, did
them.’ ” After she had done all, she hid herself on the stage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1815src" href="#xd32e1815">4</a>
</p>
<p>When the Mother (of the kraal) came home, she said, “Hare, who has done these things?
They look just as they used when my daughter did them.” The Hare said, “I did the
things.” But the Mother would not believe it, and looked at the calabash. Seeing it
was empty, she searched the stage and found her daughter. Then she embraced and kissed
her, and from that day the girl stayed with her mother, and did everything as she
was wont in former times; but she now remained unmarried.

<p class="small">(From Sir James E. Alexander’s “Expedition of Discovery into the Interior of Africa,”

</p>
<p>Once upon a time a certain Hottentot was travelling in company with a Bushwoman, carrying
a child on her back. They had proceeded some distance on their journey, when a troop
of wild horses appeared, and the Man said to the Woman, “I am hungry; and as I know
you can turn yourself into a Lion, do so now, and catch us a wild horse, that we may
eat.”
</p>
<p>The Woman answered, “You will be afraid.”
</p>
<p>“No, no,” said the Man; “I am afraid of dying of hunger, but not of you.”
</p>
<p>Whilst he was yet speaking, hair began to appear at the back of the Woman’s neck;
her nails gradually assumed the appearance of claws, and her features altered. She
sat down the child.
</p>
<p>The Man, alarmed at the change, climbed a tree close by. The Woman glared at him fearfully,
and going to one side, she threw off her skin petticoat, when <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1836">[<a href="#xd32e1836">90</a>]</span>a perfect Lion rushed into the plain. It bounded and crept among the bushes towards
the wild horses, and springing on one of them, it fell, and the Lion lapped its blood.
The Lion then came back to where the child was crying, and the man called from the
tree, “Enough, enough! don’t hurt me. Put off your lion’s shape, I’ll never ask to
see this again.”
</p>
<p>The Lion looked at him and growled. “I’ll remain here till I die,” said the Man, “if
you don’t become a woman again.” The mane and tail then began to disappear, the Lion
went towards the bush where the skin petticoat lay; it was slipped on, and the woman,
in her proper shape, took up the child. The Man descended and partook of the horse’s
flesh, but never again asked the Woman to catch game for him.

</p>
<p>A Bushman was, on one occasion, following a troop of zebras, and had just succeeded
in wounding one with his arrows, when a Lion sprang out from a thicket opposite, and
showed every inclination to dispute the prize with him. The Bushman being near a convenient
tree, threw down his arms, and climbed for safety to an upper branch. The Lion, allowing
the wounded zebra to pass on, now turned his whole attention towards the Bushman,
and walking round and round the tree, he ever and anon growled and looked up at him.
At length the Lion lay down at the foot of the tree, and kept watch all night. Towards
morning sleep overcame the hitherto wakeful Bushman, and he dreamt that he had fallen
into the Lion’s mouth. Starting from the effects of his dream, he lost his hold, and,
falling from the branch, he <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1852">[<a href="#xd32e1852">92</a>]</span>alighted heavily on the Lion; on which the monster, thus unexpectedly saluted, ran
off with a loud roar, and the Bushman, also taking to his heels in a different direction,
escaped in safety.

</p>
<p>An Elephant, it is said, was married to a Nama Hottentot woman, whose two brothers
came to her secretly, because they were afraid of her husband. Then she went out as
if to fetch wood, and putting them within the wood, she laid them on the stage.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1869src" href="#xd32e1869">1</a> Then she said, “Since I married into this kraal, has a wether been slaughtered also
for me?” And her blind mother-in-law <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1873">[<a href="#xd32e1873">94</a>]</span>answered, “Umph! things are said by the wife of my eldest son, which she never said
before.”
</p>
<p>Thereupon the Elephant, who had been in the field, arrived, and smelling something,
rubbed against the house. “Ha,” said his wife, “what I should not have done formerly,
I do now. On what day did you slaughter a wether for me?” Then the mother-in-law said
to him: “As she says things which she did not say (before), do it now.”
</p>
<p>In this manner a wether was slaughtered (for her), which she roasted whole, and then,
in the same night (after supper), asked her mother-in-law the following questions:—“How
do you breathe when you sleep the sleep of life? (light sleep, half-conscious.) And
how when you sleep the sleep of death?” (deep sleep.)
</p>
<p>Then the mother-in-law said, “Umph, an evening full of conversation! When we sleep
the sleep of death, we breathe thus: ‘<i lang="naq">sũi sũi!</i>’ and when we sleep the sleep of life we breathe thus: ‘<i lang="naq">Χou ǃáwaba! Χou ǃáwaba!</i>’ ”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1885src" href="#xd32e1885">2</a>
</p>
<p>Thus the wife made everything right whilst they fell asleep. Then she listened to
their snoring, and <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1897">[<a href="#xd32e1897">95</a>]</span>when they slept thus, <i lang="naq">sũi sũi</i>, she rose and said to her two brothers, “The sleep of death is over them, let us
make ready.” They rose and went out, and she broke up the hut<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e1902src" href="#xd32e1902">3</a> (to carry away all that she could), and took the necessary things, and said, “That
thing which makes any noise wills my death.” So they kept altogether quiet.
</p>
<p>When her two brothers had packed up, she went with them between the cattle, but she
left at home one cow, one ewe, and one goat, and directed them, saying to the cow,
“You must not low as if you were by yourself alone, if you do not wish for my death;”
and she taught the ewe and the goat the same.
</p>
<p>Then they departed with all the other cattle, and those who were left behind lowed
during the night as if they were many, and as they lowed as if they were still all
there, the Elephant thought, “They are all there.” But when he rose in the morning,
he saw that his wife and all the cattle were gone. Taking his stick into his hands,
he said to his mother, “If I fall the earth will tremble.” With these words he followed
them. When they saw him approaching, they ran fast to the side, against a piece of
rock (at a <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1908">[<a href="#xd32e1908">96</a>]</span>narrow spot), and she said, “We are people, behind whom a large (travelling) party
comes. Stone of my ancestors! divide thyself for us.” Then the rock divided itself,
and when they had passed through it, it closed again (behind them).
</p>
<p>Then came the Elephant, and said to the rock, “Stone of my ancestors! divide thyself
also for me.” The rock divided itself again, but when he had entered, it closed upon
him. Thus died the Elephant, and the earth trembled. The mother at her hut said then,
“As my eldest son said, it has happened. The earth shakes.”

<p>Copper and Weather, it is said, were man and wife, and begat a daughter, who married
amongst other people.
</p>
<p>Her three brothers came to visit her; and she did not know them (as such), though
the people said, “Do not you see they are your brothers?” She determined to kill them
at night. They had, however, a Guinea-fowl to watch them.
</p>
<p>When the Copper-Weather relative crept near, in order to kill the men, the Guinea-fowl
made a noise to put them on their guard. They were thus warned of the danger; but
afterwards they fell asleep again. Then she stole again upon them. The Guinea-fowl
made a noise, but broke the rope by which it had been fastened, and ran home. She
then killed her brothers. When the Guinea-fowl came near home it wept:—

they burnt the kraal and all its inhabitants.

sitting by the wayside, but passed him without notice. The Jackal, however, who came
after them, and saw him also sitting, went to him and said, “Such a fine little child
is left behind by the men.” He then took the Sun up, and put it into his awa-skin

Sun stuck fast to his back, and burnt the Jackal’s back black from that day.

<p>The Moon, it is said, sent once an Insect to Men, saying, “Go thou to Men, and tell
them, ‘As I die, and dying live, so ye shall also die, and dying live.’ ” The Insect
started with the message, but whilst on his way was overtaken by the Hare, who asked:
“On what errand art thou bound?” The Insect answered: “I am sent by the Moon to Men,
to tell them that as she dies, and dying lives, they also shall die, and dying live.”
The Hare said, “As thou art an awkward runner, let me go” (to take the message). With
these words he ran off, and when he reached Men, he said, “I am sent by the Moon to
tell you, ‘As I die, and dying perish, in the same manner ye shall also die and come
wholly to an end.’ ” Then the Hare returned to the Moon, and told her what he had
said to Men. The Moon reproached him angrily, saying, “Darest thou tell <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e1965">[<a href="#xd32e1965">102</a>]</span>the people a thing which I have not said?” With these words she took up a piece of

<p>The Moon, on one occasion, sent the Hare to the earth to inform Men that as she (the
Moon) died away and rose again, so mankind should die and rise again. Instead, however,
of delivering this message as given, the Hare, either out of forgetfulness or malice,
told mankind that as the Moon rose and died away, so Man should die and rise no more.
The Hare, having returned to the Moon, was questioned as to the message delivered,
and the Moon, having heard the true state of the case, became so enraged with him
that she took up a hatchet to split his head; falling short, however, of that, the
hatchet fell upon the upper lip of the Hare, and cut it severely. Hence it is that
we see the “Hare-lip.” The Hare, being duly incensed at having received such treatment,
raised his claws, and scratched the Moon’s face; and the dark parts which we now see
on the surface of the Moon are the scars which she received on that occasion.

<p>It is said that when <i lang="naq">Heitsi Eibip</i> was travelling about with his family, they came to a valley in which the raisin-tree
was ripe, and he was there attacked by a severe illness. Then his young (second) wife
said, “This brave one is taken ill on account of these raisins; death is here at the
place.” The old man (<i lang="naq">Heitsi Eibip</i>), however, told his son <i lang="naq">ǃUrisip</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd32e2179src" href="#xd32e2179">5</a> (the whitish one), “I shall not live, I feel it; thou must, therefore, cover me when
I am dead with soft stones.” And he spoke further, “This is the thing which I order
you to do:—‘Of the raisin-trees of this valley ye shall not eat. For if ye eat of
them I shall infect you, and ye will surely die in a similar way.’ ”
</p>
<p>His young wife said, “He is taken ill on account of the raisins of this valley. Let
us bury him quickly, and let us go.”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2186">[<a href="#xd32e2186">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>So he died there, and was covered flatly with soft stones according as he had commanded.
Then they went away from him.
</p>
<p>When they had moved to another place, and were unpacking there, they heard always
from the side whence they came a noise as of people eating raisins and singing. In
this manner the eating and singing ran:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">

said, “It is he alone; therefore act thus:—

<p class="first small">(From a German original Manuscript in Sir G. Grey’s Library, H.&nbsp;C. Knudsen’s “Notes
on the Hottentots,” pp. 7, 8.)
</p>
<p>In the beginning there were two. One was blind, the other was always hunting. This
hunter found at last a hole in the earth, from which game proceeded, and killed the
young. The blind man, feeling and smelling them, said, “They are not game, but cattle.”
</p>
<p>The blind man afterwards recovered his sight, and going with the hunter to this hole,
saw that they were cows with their calves. He then quickly built a kraal (fence made
of thorns) round them, and anointed himself, just as Hottentots (in their native state)
are still wont to do.
</p>
<p>When the other, who now with great trouble had to seek his game, came and saw this,
he wanted to anoint himself also. “Look here!” said the other, “you must throw the
ointment into the fire, and afterwards use it.” He followed this advice, and the flames
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2226">[<a href="#xd32e2226">116</a>]</span>flaring up into his face, burnt him most miserably; so that he was glad to make his
escape. The other, however, called to him: “Here, take the kirri (a knobstick), and
run to the hills, to hunt there for honey.”
</p>
<p>Hence sprung the race of Bushmen.

<h3 class="main">41. THE LITTLE WISE WOMAN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">(The original, in the Hottentot language, is in Sir G. Grey’s Library, G. Krönlein’s
Manuscript, p. 53.)
</p>
<p>A girl, it is said, went to seek for onions. As she arrived at the place where they
grew, she met with some men, one of whom was blind (<i>i.e.</i>, half-blind, having only one eye). As she dug (for the onions) the men helped her,
digging also. When her sack was full, they said to her, “Go, tell the other girls,
that many of you may come.” So she went home and told her companions, and early the
next morning they started. But a little girl followed them. The other girls said,
“Let the little girl go back.” But her elder sister protested against this, saying,
“She runs by herself, you need not put her into your awa-skin.”
</p>
<p>So they went all together, and having reached the onion-ground, began to dig. Now
the little girl saw <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2245">[<a href="#xd32e2245">118</a>]</span>traces of feet, and said to the one who had guided them thither, “Wonderful! whence
so many traces? Were you not alone here?” The other replied, “I walked about and looked
out; therefore they must of course be many.” The child, however, did not believe that
if the other girl had been alone the traces could be many, and felt uneasy; for she
was a wise little woman. From time to time she rose (from her work) and peeped about,
and once, while doing this, found by chance an ant-eater’s hole. Still further spying
about, she perceived some men, but they did not see her. She then returned and continued
digging with the other girls, without, however, saying anything. But in the midst
of their work she always rose and looked about her. So the others asked her, “Why
do you always spy about you, and leave off digging? What a girl!” But she continued
her work in silence. When she rose from it again, she saw the men approaching. As
they drew near the One-eyed blew through a reed pipe the following air:—
</p>
<p>“To-day there shall blood flow, blood flow, blood flow!”
</p>
<p>The little girl understood what was blown on the reed. She said to the elder ones,
whilst they were dancing, “Do you also understand the tune that is blown on the reed?”
But they only said, “What a <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2250">[<a href="#xd32e2250">119</a>]</span>child she is!” So she mixed in the dance with the others; but managed while so doing
to tie her sister’s caross-cloak to her own, and in this manner they danced on, till
it became very noisy, and then they found an opportunity to slip away.
</p>
<p>On their way out the little sister asked, “Do you understand the reed—I mean what
is blown on it?” She answered, “I do not understand it.” Then the little girl explained
to her that the tune on the reed said, “To-day blood shall flow!” When they walked
along, the little girl let her elder sister go first, and herself followed, walking
backwards, and carefully stepping in her sister’s traces, so that they thus left only
one set of footmarks, and these going in a contrary direction. In this manner they
arrived at the ant-eater’s hole.
</p>
<p>But the men killed all those girls who had remained dancing with them. When the eldest
of those who had escaped heard their wailing, she said, “Alas, my sisters!” But the
younger one answered her, “Do you think you would have lived if you had remained there?”
</p>
<p>Now “One-eye” was the first to miss the sisters, and said to the other men, “Where
may the two handsome girls be who danced with me?” The others replied, “He lies. He
has seen with his eye<span class="corr" id="xd32e2256" title="Not in source">”</span> (satirically <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2258">[<a href="#xd32e2258">120</a>]</span>meaning he had seen wrongly). But “One-eye” insisted that “two girls were truly missing.”
Then they went to find their spoor, but the traces had been rendered indistinct enough
to puzzle them.
</p>
<p>When the men arrived at the ant-eater’s hole, they could not see that the footmarks
went further, so they spied into the hole, but saw nothing. Then “One-eye” looked
also, and he saw the girls, and cried, “There they sit.” The others now looked again,
but still saw nothing; for the girls had covered themselves with cobwebs.
</p>
<p>One of the men then took an assegai, and piercing through the upper part of the hole,
hit the heel of the larger girl. But the little wise woman took hold of the assegai,
and wiped off the blood. The elder sister was about to cry, but the little one warned
her not.
</p>
<p>When “One-eye” spied again, the little girl made big eyes at him. He said, “There
she sits.” The others looked too, but as they could see nothing they said (satirically),
“He has only seen with his eye.”
</p>
<p>At last the men got thirsty, and said to “One-eye,” “Stay you here, and let us go
to drink, and when we have returned you may go also.”
</p>
<p>When “One-eye” was left alone there, the little girl said (conjuring him):
<span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2267">[<a href="#xd32e2267">121</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“You dirty son of your father,
</p>
<p class="line">Are you there? Are you alone not thirsty?
</p>
<p class="line">Oh, you dirty child of your father!
</p>
<p class="line">Dirty child of your father!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">“I am indeed thirsty,” said “One-eye,” and went away.
</p>
<p>Then the two girls came out of the hole, and the younger one took her elder sister
on her back, and walked on. As they were going over the bare, treeless plain, the
men saw them, and said, “There they are, far off,” and ran after them.
</p>
<p>When they came near, the two girls turned themselves into thorn trees, called “Wait-a-bit,”
and the beads which they wore became gum on the trees. The men then ate of the gum
and fell asleep. Whilst they slept, the girls smeared gum over the men’s eyes and
went away, leaving them lying in the sun.
</p>
<p>The girls were already near their kraal, when “One-eye” awoke, and said:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Oh, the disgrace! fie on thee!
</p>
<p class="line">Our eyes are smeared over; fie on thee, my brother!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then they removed the gum from their eyes, and hunted after the girls; but the latter
reached home in safety, and told their parents what had happened.
</p>
<p>Then all lamented greatly, but they remained quietly at home, and did not search for
the other girls.

<h3 class="sub">OR, A RECEIPT FOR PUTTING ANY ONE TO SLEEP.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first small">(The original, in the o Tyi-hereró or Dámara language, is in Sir G. Grey’s Library,
J. Rath’s Manuscript, pp. 39, 43.)
</p>
<p>There was a little girl who had an <i lang="naq">eïngi</i> (pronounced <i lang="naq">a-inghi</i>, some kind of fruit). She said to her Mother, “Mother, why is it that you do not
say, ‘My first-born, give me the <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>?’ Do I refuse it?”
</p>
<p><span id="xd32e2302"></span>Her Mother said, “My first-born, give me the <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>.” She gave it to her and went away, and her Mother ate the <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>.
</p>
<p>When the child came back, she said, “Mother, give me my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>?” but her Mother answered, “I have eaten the <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>!”
</p>
<p>The child said, “Mother, how is it that you have eaten my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>, which I plucked from our tree?” The Mother then (to appease her) gave her a needle.
</p>
<p>The little girl went away and found her Father sewing thongs with thorns; so she said,
“Father, how is it that you sew with thorns? Why do not you say, <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2325">[<a href="#xd32e2325">123</a>]</span>‘My first-born, give me your needle?’ Do I refuse?” So her Father said, “My first-born,
give me your needle.” She gave it to him and went away for a while. Her Father commenced
sewing, but the needle broke; when, therefore, the child came back and said, “Father,
give me my needle,” he answered, “The needle is broken;” but she complained about
it, saying, “Father, how is it that you break my needle, which I got from Mother,
who ate my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>, which I had plucked from our tree?” Her Father then gave her an axe.
</p>
<p>Going farther on she met the lads who were in charge of the cattle. They were busy
taking out honey, and in order to get at it they were obliged to cut down the trees
with stones. She addressed them: “Our sons, how is it that you use stones in order
to get at the honey? Why do not you say, ‘Our first-born, give us the axe?’ Do I refuse,
or what do I?” They said, “Our first-born, give us the axe.” So she gave it them,
and went away for some time. The axe broke entirely. When she came back she asked,
“Where is the axe? Please give it me.” They answered, “The axe is broken.” She then
said, “How is it that you break my axe, which I had received from Father who had broken
my needle, which I got from Mother who had eaten my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>, which I <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2335">[<a href="#xd32e2335">124</a>]</span>had plucked from our tree?” But they gave her some honey (to comfort her).
</p>
<p>She went her way again, and met a little old woman, eating insects, to whom she said,
“Little old woman, how is it that you eat insects? Why don’t you say, ‘My first-born,
give me honey?’ Do I refuse or not?” Then the little old woman asked, “My first-born,
give me honey.” She gave it her and went away; but presently returning, said, “Little
old woman, let me have my honey!” Now the old woman had managed to eat it all during
her absence, so she answered, “Oh! I have eaten the honey!” So the child complained,
saying, “How is it that you eat my honey, which I received from the lads of our cattle,
from our children who had broken my axe, which had been given me by Father who had
broken my needle, which was a present from my Mother who had eaten up my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>, that I had plucked from our tree?”
</p>
<p>The little old woman gave her food, and she went away. This time she came to the pheasants,
who scratched the ground; and she said, “Pheasants! how is it that you scratch the
ground? Why do not you say, ‘First-born, give us food?’ Do I refuse, or what do I?”
They said, “First-born, give.” So she gave to them, and went away. When she came <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2344">[<a href="#xd32e2344">125</a>]</span>back and demanded her food again, they said, “We have eaten the food.” She asked,
“How is it that you eat my food, which I had received from a little old woman who
had eaten up my honey, that I had got from the lads of our cattle who had broken my
axe, which had been given me by my Father who had broken my needle, which was a present
from my Mother who had eaten my <i lang="naq">eïngi</i>, which I had plucked from our tree?” The pheasants, flying up, pulled out each one
a feather and threw them down to the little girl.
</p>
<p>She then, walking along, met the children who watched the sheep. They were plucking
out hairs from the sheep-skins. So she asked them, “How is it that you pull at these
skins? Why do not you say, ‘First-born, give us the feathers?’ Do I refuse, or what
do I?” They said, “First-born, give us the feathers.” She gave them and went away,
but all the feathers broke. When she returned and said, “Give me my feathers,” they
answered, “The feathers are broken.” Then she complained, “Do you break my feathers
which I received from the pheasants who had eaten my food, which had been given me
by a little old woman?” They gave her some milk.
</p>
<p>She went again on her way, and found their own <span class="pageNum" id="xd32e2353">[<a href="#xd32e2353">126</a>]</span>handsome dog gnawing bones. She said, “Our dog, how is it that you gnaw these bones?”
The dog answered, “Give me milk.” She gave it him, and he drank it all. Then she said
to the dog, “Give me back my milk.” He said, “I drank it.” She then repeated the same
words which she had spoken so often before; but the dog ran away, and when she pursued
him, he scampered up a tree. She climbed up after him, but the dog jumped down again
on the other side. She wanted to do the same, but could not. Then she said, “Our dog,
please help me down.” He answered, “Why did you pursue me?” and ran away leaving her
up the tree.
</p>
<p>“That is enough,” say the Damara.
